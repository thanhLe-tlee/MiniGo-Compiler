## üìå Description
- This is a simplified version of Go programming language, designed for students to practice building a compiler. It retains the core concepts of Go, such as basic data types, structs and interfaces. The goal of this project was to understand how a compiler works from scratch and apply theoretical knowledge into practice by building each stage step by step.

- In this project, the compiler supports key phases of compilation, including:
- **Lexical Analysis**
- **Parsing** (Abstract Syntax Tree construction)
- **Semantic Analysis**
- **Intermediate Code Generation**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- Custom grammar for MiniGo
- Internal testing and code generation tools

---

## üöÄ How to Run

```bash
# Step 1: Change to the source directory
cd initial/src

# Step 2: Generate intermediate files (e.g., AST, IR)
python run.py gen

# Step 3: Run tests with provided test suites
python run.py test CodeGenSuite
